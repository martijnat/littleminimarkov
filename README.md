# Little Mini Markov (LLM)

Simple tiny markov chain implementation to generate text. I wanted to see how simple I could make it with half coherent ouput.

It will train on plaintext ascii input to learn to predict the next character.
For each 3 character input, it will generate a 4th input and then
continue from there.

It learns by reading every 4 bytes of data and recording how often it sees it. It will then compress the data to 2 bit precision, scaled by each 3 byte prefix. When generating it will use the relative probability of each 4th byte to randomly generate each succesive byte.

# sample output
